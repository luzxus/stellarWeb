          I began my journey at Halmstad universtity where i studied information
          systems. I chose this because i wanted a broad education to learn many
          things within the IT domain. Eventually i found out that i really
          enjoyed coding and to develop things.
          <br />
          During my internship I got to learn and eventually implement
          <span className="font-bold"> RPA </span>
          (Robotic Process Automation) to help a medtech company automate their
          processes. My mentors were experienced developers and I felt a joy in
          learning more technology than just RPA. So i began learning Python,
          Java and C#.
          <br />
          <br />
          When the time came for me to graduate I applied for a trainee program
          at Tata Consultancy Services as a software developer. I got the job
          and i began learning{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">
            Javascript, HTML, CSS and eventually React
          </span>{' '}
          to prepare for my upcoming project. I learned a lot during my first 3
          months and then it was time for me to move on.
          <br />
          <br />I joined another frontend project and learned
          <span className="font-bold"> Angular </span>. I was in this project
          for about a year before I applied for a job at another company called
          Forefront Consulting. After 1.5 years I am still at Forefront and im
          thriving and learning new technologies, i get to experiment with
          different tech stacks and discuss exciting subjects with my
          colleagues. */}
        <p>
          I have worked as a fullstack developer for three years where I have
          worked with languages such as Java, C#, React and Angular as well as
          Microsoft Azure.
